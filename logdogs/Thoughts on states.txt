Okay well clutch or kick, basically states are persistent regardless of what state you are in.
Thus, it can be found that once you've set a state to be 'finished' then proceed to the next state,
the previous state's information would be in "stasis", meaning once you return to it, it'll be the way you've left it.
This means that pause screens naturally would freeze the game world (if you so choose), and it also means that you will
have to (again if you so choose) "place the chess pieces back" to where they used to be when you decide to go back,
else you'll go back there finding it the same way you've left it. That's where the cleanup method does its thing.

States are painful.
